# 🪙 Gullak — Micro-Savings for the Future

**Gullak** is a smart micro-pension platform built for India’s gig workers, daily wage earners, and people in the unorganized sector who currently lack access to formal retirement plans.

With small, automatic savings triggered by income detection via UPI/SMS, Gullak helps users effortlessly build long-term financial security — ₹10 at a time.

## 🌟 Why Gullak?

India has over 400 million informal workers, most of whom have no retirement security.

They move jobs frequently, often live paycheck-to-paycheck, and are left out of structured pension schemes.

Gullak empowers them to save in tiny, flexible amounts whenever they earn — building a portable savings identity they can carry wherever life takes them.
